## About The Project

Pneumonia Detection Using Various Neural Networks Architecture and using Transfer Learning on VGG16 as Pretrained Model


## Built With

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [VGG16](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

You will need:

- Python 
- Tensorflow 
- scikit-learn
- Flask


### Installation

1. Make sure you have python3 setup on your system
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/Pneumonia-Detection.git
```
3. Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. [Download]() Pre-Trained Weights
4. Run app.py 
```sh
python app.py
```

## Train Your Own Model

If you want to train your own model

### Procedure

1. Make sure you have python3 setup on your system
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/Pneumonia-Detection.git
```
3. Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Read Documentation and see which model architecture you want to use or fit best for your model.
5. Set Parameters according to your dataset then :
6. Run model_2_1_architecture.py
```sh
python model_2_1_architecture.py
```
7. Run model_3_1_architecture.py
```sh
python model_3_1_architecture.py
```
8. Run model_4_2_architecture.py
```sh
python model_4_2_architecture.py
```
9. Your Trained Model is automatically saved in models folder
10. Change Your model name in app.py and then test your model
11. Run app.py 
```sh
python app.py
```
